# WHAT IS A PIP PACKAGE?

PIP is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like. What it allows you to do is it 
lets you to call outside packages that are stored inside of what is called the Pypi store or the cheese 
shop. And it allows you to bring in all of this python code the other developers have made so that you 
can use them in your own applications which is a very cool way of being able to build out your systems.

## PIP installation

1. In order to use it, you first have to install it on your system and the installation process is 
actually going to use just pure python. So you're going to come to this page: [An internal link] 
(https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and this is going to work the same way if you're on a Mac or 
Windows or Linux machine and then you are going to download this file. So you're going to click on 
*get-pip.py* and then this is going to bring up this file you can see that this is just a *.py* file and so you can save this on your machine.

2. Once you have it there all you're going to have to do is open up the terminal and run it like a 
regular python file. So if I open up the terminal right here all I would have to run is python and then 
*get-pip.py* hit return and then it will go and it will install the entire pip library on your system.

3. Now to make sure that this is working after you've run that code simply type in *pip --version* and 
if it's installed on your system then it is going to show it right here.
If you get an error message it means that you might have an issue say you maybe didn't call the file 
correctly or you tried to run it on the wrong version of the file or anything like that but assuming 
everything worked you should have output on the screen right here that says something like pip and then 
the version.
